### Hi there 👋

I am a linguist turned full-stack developer 👨‍💻 with experience in finance, marketing, and AdTech. I am passionate about finding simple solutions to complex problems and making processes more efficient.

Two fun facts about me:
- I bike toured from St. Augustine, FL to Los Angeles, CA in 2010 🚲
- I have a pet cat named Millie 🐈
