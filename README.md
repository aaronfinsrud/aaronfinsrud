### Hi there 👋

I am a linguist turned full-stack developer 👨‍💻 with a non-traditional background in finance, marketing, and AdTech. I am passionate about finding simple solutions to complex problems and making processes more efficient through automation.

Two fun facts about me:
- I bike toured from St. Augustine, FL to Los Angeles, CA in 2010 🚲
- The 'rud' in Fins-rud is Old Norse for "clearing in the woods" 🌲
